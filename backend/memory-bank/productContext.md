# Product Context: Digital Gemba Root Cause Analysis

## Problem Being Solved
This API helps manufacturing and operational teams efficiently identify, analyze, and address root causes of problems in their processes. Traditional root cause analysis is often time-consuming, inconsistent, and may miss important factors. This digital solution streamlines the process using AI.

## User Goals
- Quickly identify potential root causes for operational problems
- Merge similar root causes from different users/teams for unified analysis
- Get actionable suggestions for both temporary fixes and preventive measures
- Evaluate the quality of identified root causes against benchmark criteria
- Access consistent, AI-powered analysis to supplement human expertise

## User Experience
The API is designed to integrate with frontend applications that would provide:
- Problem input interfaces for users to describe issues
- Visualization of suggested root causes
- Tools for merging similar root causes
- Action suggestion displays
- Scoring dashboards for root cause quality assessment

The system aims to enhance human decision-making rather than replace it, providing consistent analysis while preserving user contributions and context.
