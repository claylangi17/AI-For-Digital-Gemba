# Progress: Digital Gemba Root Cause Analysis

## Overall Status
- Initial exploration of the codebase completed
- Memory Bank structure established for maintaining project context
- Project appears to be a functional FastAPI application for root cause analysis

## What Works
Based on initial code review:
- API endpoints for root cause suggestion, action suggestion, and scoring
- Root cause merging functionality
- Area retrieval for UI dropdown population
- Authentication via API key
- Error handling with graceful degradation

## What's Left
- Further exploration of AI model implementation details
- Understanding database schema and operations
- Testing API endpoints for functionality
- Potential improvements or feature additions

## Known Issues
- None identified yet during initial exploration

## Decision Log
- Created Memory Bank structure to maintain project context
- Identified key components and their interactions
- Recognized the pattern of request/response models and dependency injection
