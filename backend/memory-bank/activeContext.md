# Active Context: Digital Gemba Root Cause Analysis

## Current Focus
- Refactoring semantic search implementation to improve relevance of historical data
- Moving semantic search functionality from AI module to database connector
- Implementing sequential filtering for action suggestions
- Adding detailed logging for API calls and raw AI responses
- Optimizing token usage in AI prompts
- Improving AI response quality by making answers more tegas (decisive)

## Recent Changes
- Moved semantic search functionality from AI module to database connector
- Created specialized functions for root cause and action suggestions
- Implemented sequential filtering for action suggestions (problem â†’ root cause)
- Modified AI prompts to provide more decisive answers without alternatives using "/"
- Added detailed logging for API calls and raw AI responses
- Limited historical data sent to AI to top 5 most relevant records to reduce token usage
- Standardized top_k parameter to 5 across all semantic search functions
- Implemented semantic search using Sentence Transformers to improve relevance of historical data

## Next Steps
- Test the API endpoints to ensure they're working correctly after the environment fix
- Consider updating dependencies if needed for compatibility with Python 3.13.3
- Further explore the AI model implementation in ai.py
- Review the database connectivity in database.py

## Active Decisions
- Using Python 3.13.3 for the project environment
- Using FastAPI for the REST API framework
- Implementing API key-based authentication
- Structuring the application with separate modules for AI, database, and authentication

## Recent Patterns/Learnings
- The API follows a pattern of request/response models defined with Pydantic
- Dependency injection is used for database and AI model access
- Error handling includes graceful degradation (e.g., in the scoring function)
- Virtual environments need to be created with the correct Python version reference
